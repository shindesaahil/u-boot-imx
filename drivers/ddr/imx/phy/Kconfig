config IMX_REDUCE_DMEM_PADDING
	bool "Reduce DMEM padding to 4KB"
	default n
	---help---
	DMEM firmware files are padded to 16KB, wasting precious space
	in processor internal RAM (TMU). The actual size of these files
	is less than 2KB, so padding them to 4KB is sufficient.

	This changes the expected size of DMEM firmware.
	It relies on boot image creation tools to generate 4KB padding.
